# nbbp

## Overview

`nbbp` is an R package for inferring the effective reproduction number and dispersion parameter from stuttering chains.

## Getting started

The R package can be installed with `remotes::install_github("CDCGov/nbbp")`, to install just the package, or with `remotes::install_github("CDCGov/nbbp", build_vignettes = TRUE)` to install the package and build vignettes.

(You can also clone or download this repository, `cd` to the resulting folder, and install the package with `devtools::install()` or, to build the vignettes, `devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)`.)

Some of the package's dependencies require additional system-level dependencies to work, such as [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The [Posit Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/) is useful for determining what needs to be run to install these on your operating system, e.g. [for rstan](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/cran/packages/overview?search=rstan).

When installing, the package will compile a [stan model](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) and print a fair bit of text to screen.
This is expected and can be ignored as long as the installation is successful.

If building the vignettes, after loading the package in R (`library("nbbp")`), the following vignettes will be available:

- `vignette("nbbp")`: introduction to the package and inference when all chains are completely observed and extinct
- `vignette("advanced_data")`: how to handle censored observations and very large (or non-extinct) chains
- `vignette("default_priors")`: plots of default priors and prior predictive distributions
